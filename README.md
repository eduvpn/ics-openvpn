OpenVPN for Android -EduVPN fork
=============
![build status](https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)


The EduVPN changes are:

* [Explicitly import support-v4 library](https://github.com/eduvpn/ics-openvpn/commit/b5eb68ea8749314342cd454cdda7766dbb36977c): Support-v4 was removed as a transitional dependency, so we have to import it explicitly now for the parent activity fix.
* [Librarify module](https://github.com/eduvpn/ics-openvpn/commit/c5af0126f61a893e3e30d69bc5b7e209781e497c): This converts the submodule to a library with as less changes as possible.
* [Change activity which opens when tapping notification](https://github.com/eduvpn/ics-openvpn/commit/5987a435b6e61548330e6fc0827989e92f44ec41): Opens a different activity when tapping on the notification
* [Fix parent activity problem](https://github.com/eduvpn/ics-openvpn/commit/8b69a964fe9b30f4430a04df03b1fa444efb0ee7): Opens the correct parent activity from the log window.
* [Replace switch with if for library project](https://github.com/eduvpn/ics-openvpn/commit/ce38d0b12ff5327b82a8a4aa3993395fddad5eeb)
* [Support gradle 6.9.1](https://github.com/eduvpn/ics-openvpn/commit/68e511a4feea818cc6e401cba3772adca5b02df8)

Developing
---------------
If you want to develop on ics-openvpn please read the [doc/README.txt](https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn/blob/master/doc/README.txt) *before* opening issues or emailing me. 

Also please note that before contributing to the project that I would like to retain my ability to relicense the project for different third parties and therefore probably need a contributer's agreement from any contributing party. To get started, [sign the Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/schwabe/ics-openvpn).

You can help
------------
Even if you are no programmer you can help by translating the OpenVPN client into your native language. [Crowdin provides a free service for non commercial open source projects](https://crowdin.net/project/ics-openvpn/invite) (Fixing/completing existing translations is very welcome as well)

FAQ
-----
You can find the FAQ here (same as in app): https://ics-openvpn.blinkt.de/FAQ.html

Controlling from external apps
------------------------------

There is the AIDL API for real controlling (see developing section). Due to high demand also the Activities `de.blinkt.openvpn.api.DisconnectVPN` and `de.blinkt.openvpn.api.ConnectVPN` exist. It uses `de.blinkt.openvpn.api.profileName` as extra for the name of the VPN profile.

Note to administrators
------------------------

You make your life and that of your users easier if you embed the certificates into the .ovpn file. You or the users can mail the .ovpn as a attachment to the phone and directly import and use it. Also downloading and importing the file works. The MIME Type should be application/x-openvpn-profile. 

Inline files are supported since OpenVPN 2.1rc1 and documented in the  [OpenVPN 2.3 man page](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn23ManPage) (under INLINE FILE SUPPORT) 

(Using inline certifaces can also make your life on non-Android platforms easier since you only have one file.)

For example `ca mycafile.pem` becomes
```
  <ca>
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  MIIHPTCCBSWgAwIBAgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQQFADB5MRAwDgYDVQQKEwdSb290
  [...]
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  </ca>
```
